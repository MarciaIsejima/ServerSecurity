"Gaming Grants Paid to Community Organizations - Final 2018/19 Year-End Report (by community) - April 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019",,,,,
,,,,,
"Generated: April 05, 2019",,,,,
"Report Period: April 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019 (Government fiscal year 2018/19)",,,,,
,,,,,
Description and Notes:,,,,,
"Community organizations may be eligible for government community gaming grants to support their programs and services. Payments for approved grants are made throughout each government fiscal year, and the timing of the payments depends on the grant category / sector.

- Unused grant funds that were returned during the fiscal year are shown at the end of this report.
- Some organizations receive grants in more than one category; therefore the number of unique organizations receiving grant payments is usually less than the number of grants paid.
- B.C. provincial electoral district information is determined by using postal codes with Elections BC data. Electoral district information in this report reflects information that was available at the time the report was generated, but may not be completely accurate due to address changes or postal code re-purposing by Canada Post.",,,,,
"++ Multiculturalism grants were a one-time grant available in government fiscal year 2012/13 offered and funded by the Ministry of Finance and Minister Responsible for Multiculturalism. These grants are not considered gaming grants, but are shown in this report because they were administered by the Gaming Policy and Enforcement Branch.

- Electoral districts are determined from the organization's physical or mailing address postal code. Mappings of postal codes to electoral districts are provided by Elections BC. Errors in determining an organization's electoral district may occur if the postal code is not correct due to data entry errors, Canada Post postal code changes, or outdated addresses.",,,,,
